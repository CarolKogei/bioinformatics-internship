# Introduction
This report summarises my experience during the bioinformatics incubation and mentorship program at *icipe* during the period of 06/10/2021 to 31/01/2022. The program constists of two months intensive training and another 2 months of working in a mini-project that is a branch of an ongoing genomic activity. The progragram guarantees an all rounded experience ranging from soft skills to technical skills moreso in programming.
I was honored to be part of cohort-4 group I was priviledged to share this experience with my fellow interns.

# Objectives
The programs seeks to mold outstanding bioinformaticians through mentorship and technical training and therefore, objectives are specific to an individual depending on the area of expertise one chooses to specialize. During the first week we came up with a roadmap of what we wanted to achieve during the internship, summarised to the following:

* To improve on my programming skills in python and the UNIX shell
* To take part in a genomics project
* To develop soft skills and network with individuals in the field of data science 

# My experience
## Training
The training period,which took place within the first two months of the program, was a wholesome experience to say the least. It consisted of activities ranging from simple softskills such as presentation skills to technical training of computer programs and languages such as python and the UNIX shell. It was a rigorous process which was made simple and achieveable with the help of a great team at the Molecular Biology and Bioinformatics Unit.
My highlights included an introduction to bionformatics concept, the UNIX shell, Nextflow workflows, Machine Learning concepts, soft skills and python language.

## Reproducing a scientific paper
One of the program deliverables was to reproduce a scientific paper assigned to us by the instructor. The task was a collaborative project of two individuals, and we worked with my partner to reproduce the paper, '[A Phylogenetic and Phenotypic Analysis of *Salmonella enterica Serovar Weltevreden*, an Emerging Agent of Diarrheal Disease in Tropical Regions](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4750946/)' 
During this activity, I interacted more with bash scripting, variant calling and phylogenetic and phenotypic analysis.

## Journal club presentation
The MBBU has a journal club that meets every 2 weeks and an individual presents journal review of their choice. The meetings were one of my biggest highlights because I kept learning new concepts everyday and most importantly upskilled my presentation skillset.
I had an opportunity to deliver a presentation on the paper,'[A Long-Term Engagement with a Social Robot for Autism Therapy](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frobt.2021.669972/full)'

## Mini-Project
During the program, my partner and I were tasked with developing a machine learning algorithm that identifies an insect. Inorder to kickstart the project, we had to ildentify an insect of intrest and through consultations we decided to settle on ticks(not really insects but arachnids) a subject of interest at *icipe*.
We did a background research on the topic to identify a favorable model convenient in solving image data problem. This included going through previous research done and already developed working models to understand the best approach in developing our deep learning model.
Data availability was a challenge that we overcame by using feature transfer method - this includes training a model on something similar to the target data  so that when data becomes available it's implemented into that model after a few optimization steps - in our case we used beetles images downloaded from [kaggle.](https://www.kaggle.com/kmldas/insect-identification-from-habitus-images) This allowed us too make great strides in the model implemmentation by running 4 models and selecting the most optimal for deployment.
The project was full of great learning points and I truly enjoyed each one of them.

## Others
In addition, we also had weekly updates and progress reviews on tasks done during the week. 

# Conclusion
The whole experience has been very impactful both in my career and as an individual. Having the opportunity to be part of a team that strives for nothing less than excellence has pushed me to want nothing less for myself and also in everything that I do. My take home learning points are:
1. The importance of having a clear workflow for any task and documentation of the progess
2. Progress is progress no matter how minute
3. There is power in collaboration
